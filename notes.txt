** Data reduction - remove extra neighborhoods from crimes that don't match neighborhoods in vacant_buildings
* doesn't have to be exact address, can be near a vacant building, or also in areas near to more vacant buildings, there may be more crimes!!
what kinds of crimes nearby?
distance threshold of vacant points with nearby crime locations

1. [ 5 pts] Load the two datasets into pandas.

df = pd.read_csv('pandas_dataframe_importing_csv/example.csv')
df

----

2. [10 pts] Identify the types of the attributes in the two datasets (nominal, numeric, ratio,
intervals, etc); gather this information in a “metadata” panda.

	https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html

----

3. [30 pts] Demonstrate basic statistical descriptions for attributes of your choice (at least
two attributes, and at least one of each boxplot, histogram, quantile plot, boxplot,
quantile-quantile plot, scatterplot); explain any “useful” characteristics of those attributes
that you can draw from those statistical descriptions.

----

4. [10 pts] Use any two methods of your choice to convert non-numeric attributes of interest
into numeric ones. (eg. one hot encoding, etc)

 - 0 is identical, 1 is different
 - differential grading (pg 349 of DMCT)
 - sklearn one hot encoding LabelEncoder - https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f 
 - https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/12/beyond-one-hot-exploration-categorical-variables.html
 - https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/categorical-encoding

 - neighborhood in vacant_buildings.csv
 - crime.csv - Description,Weapon,District,Neighborhood (weapon is of interest for missing values too)

----

5. [20 pts] Demonstrate two techniques for handling missing data on attributes of your
choice.

crime.csv - weapon (extrapolating based on same class or with beysian the most probable value)
vacant_buildings - buildingAddress - ignore or manually add (only one row value missing, or prediction based on class subset )

	pg 62 of DMCT

-----

6. [20 pts] Examine two attributes of interest for potential outliers. Show the steps in your
examination and reasoning.

weapon, location (gps coords)?? 

-----

7. [20 pts] Demonstrate a technique for examining the “noise” in a data attribute of your
choice and how to “denoise” it.

address unit# or lot or block range (clustering maybe)

8. [20 pts] Demonstrate the creation for two new attributes from existing attributes that
would be useful in a preliminary assessment of dependency between crimes and
building vacancies.

 - noticeDate and CrimeDate (duringVacant bool) - crime happened after notice of vacancy, so we don't incorrectly analyze
 - just street name from both address columns - will help see potential relationship (initial direction)
 - crime code and crime category or severity (misdemeanor, felony, etc)

-----

9. [20 pts] Demonstrate how to reduce numerosity (#distinct values) of an attribute of your
choice using binning; discuss your approach and other choices.

street numbers - bin to close ones either purely by street no. or by gps location (equal width of area, varying frew heights based on # of building in a fixed area),
street numbers - bin equal frequency and see ... err.. dunno 

-----

10. [20 pts] Fuse/join information from the two datasets (crime and vacancies) into a new
panda.

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html

-----

11. [20 pts] Demonstrate data reduction using sampling techniques on subsets of attributes
of your (demonstrate sampling with and without replacement, stratified and un-stratified;
4 total combinations);

street numbers!, gps location too - cluster into areas or just street names with freq of vacant blocks on given streets

-----

12. [20 pts] For two categorical attributes of your choice, demonstrate the contingency table
and conduct a chi-squared test of independence; explain your findings.

neighborhood and weapon? (like whether firearm is related to naighborhood with a lot of vacant buildings?? 

-----

13. [20 pts] For two numerical attributes of your choice, demonstrate the covariance matrix
compute their correlation coefficient; explain/interpret your findings.

 - Notice date and crime date

 - councilDistrict and GPS coords
